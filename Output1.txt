# Assessing the Best Coffee Shops in San Francisco Based on Coffee Quality

**Problem Statement:** San Francisco has a large number of coffee shops, making it difficult for consumers to identify those offering the highest quality coffee. This research aims to establish a ranking of San Francisco coffee shops based on objective measures of coffee quality.

- Which objective metrics can be used to reliably assess these sensory characteristics?
- Based on these metrics, which San Francisco coffee shops consistently demonstrate superior coffee quality?

**Method Brief:**
- Blind taste testing of espresso and brewed coffee from a selection of San Francisco coffee shops.
- Employing a standardized sensory evaluation scale to rate aroma, taste, body, and acidity.
- Statistical analysis of the sensory data to identify significant differences between coffee shops.
- Qualitative data collection through customer reviews and interviews to supplement quantitative findings.

**Deliverables:**
- A ranked list of San Francisco coffee shops based on coffee quality.
- A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, results, and conclusions of the study.
