I want to research the best books available in India. I am interested in understanding what makes a book the 'best', considering factors such as critical acclaim, reader reviews, sales data, and cultural impact within India. I am open to all genres and types of books, as no specific preferences have been stated. Therefore, the research should cover a wide range of categories including fiction, non-fiction, and any other relevant classifications, to provide a comprehensive overview of the top-ranking books in the Indian market.
