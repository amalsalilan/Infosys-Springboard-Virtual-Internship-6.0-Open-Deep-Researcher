# Impact of ONDC on Small Retailers in India

**Problem Statement:** Small retailers struggle to digitize while competing with well-capitalized marketplaces. ONDC could expand reach but raises concerns around onboarding, fees, and discovery.

**Key Questions:**
- How does ONDC change customer acquisition and discovery for kirana stores?
- What onboarding, logistics, and pricing frictions do small retailers face?
- What metrics indicate a positive impact within 3–6 months?

**Method Brief:**
- Rapid literature and policy scan on ONDC architecture and participants
- Semi-structured interviews with 10–15 small retailers across 3 cities
- Transaction and basket-size trend analysis from pilot partners
- Benchmark against pre-ONDC digital channels

**Deliverables:**
- 5–7 page brief with metrics and retailer quotes
- Actionable playbook for onboarding and promotions
- 1-page policy considerations summary
