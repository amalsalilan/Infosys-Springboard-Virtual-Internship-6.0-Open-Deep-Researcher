# Post-Quantum Cryptography Migration for Fintechs

**Problem Statement:**  
This study investigates the transition of fintech systems to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to maintain security against quantum computing threats.

**Key Questions:**  
- Which PQC algorithms are most suitable for fintech applications?  
- What are the operational challenges in migrating existing systems?  
- How does PQC adoption impact transaction speed and security compliance?

**Method Brief:**  
1. Review current PQC algorithms and NIST recommendations.  
2. Conduct interviews with fintech security teams.  
3. Perform risk assessment on legacy cryptography systems.  
4. Prototype integration of PQC algorithms in test environments.

**Deliverables:**  
- Concise report with migration roadmap.  
- Comparison of PQC algorithm performance.  
- Recommendations for phased deployment strategies.
