    "title": "Post-Quantum Crypto Migration for Fintechs",
    "problem_statement": "The advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to the security of current public-key cryptography used extensively in the Fintech sector.  Existing cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA and ECC, are vulnerable to attacks from sufficiently powerful quantum computers.  This necessitates a timely and efficient migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial systems.",
    "key_questions": [
      "What are the most suitable PQC algorithms for various Fintech applications (e.g., digital signatures, key exchange, encryption)?",
      "What are the performance implications of migrating to PQC algorithms in terms of latency, throughput, and resource consumption?",
      "What are the security considerations and potential vulnerabilities associated with PQC implementation in Fintech systems?",
      "What are the regulatory and compliance requirements for PQC adoption in different jurisdictions?",
      "What is the cost-benefit analysis of migrating to PQC, considering implementation costs, potential losses from security breaches, and long-term security?",
      "What are the best practices and strategies for a phased migration to PQC to minimize disruption and ensure a smooth transition?"
