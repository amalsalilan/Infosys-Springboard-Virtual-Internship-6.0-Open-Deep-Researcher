# Post-Quantum Crypto Migration for Fintechs
**Date:** 2025-08-28

**Problem Statement:** Fintechs face significant risk from the advent of quantum computing, which can break widely used public-key cryptography.  A timely and effective migration strategy is crucial to maintain data security and customer trust.

**Key Questions:**
- What are the most vulnerable cryptographic algorithms currently used by fintechs?
- What are the most suitable post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for fintech applications?
- What are the technical and logistical challenges of migrating to post-quantum cryptography?
- What is the cost-benefit analysis of different migration strategies?
- What regulatory and compliance considerations need to be addressed?

**Method Brief:**
- Literature review of post-quantum cryptography and its applications in finance.
- Analysis of existing fintech security infrastructure and cryptographic implementations.
- Evaluation of different post-quantum algorithms based on security, performance, and implementation complexity.
- Development of a migration roadmap for a representative fintech system.
- Cost-benefit analysis of different migration approaches.

**Deliverables:**
- A report summarizing the findings of the literature review and analysis.
- A comparative analysis of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.
- A proposed migration roadmap for fintechs.
- A cost-benefit analysis of different migration strategies.
- Recommendations for regulatory and compliance considerations.
