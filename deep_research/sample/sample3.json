  "date": "2025-08-26",
  "objective": "To assess the long-term risks and implications of inaction on climate change, specifically focusing on the impact on coastal communities.",
  "key_questions": [
    "What are the projected sea-level rise scenarios for the next 50-100 years?",
    "How will increased storm intensity and frequency affect coastal infrastructure and populations?",
    "What are the potential economic consequences of coastal erosion and displacement?",
    "What are the social and health impacts of climate-related migration and displacement?",
    "What are the potential cascading effects on ecosystems and biodiversity?",
    "What adaptation and mitigation strategies can effectively reduce long-term risks?"
  ],
  "methodology": [
    "Literature review of peer-reviewed scientific articles and reports from reputable organizations.",
    "Analysis of existing climate change models and projections.",
    "Case studies of vulnerable coastal communities.",
    "Data analysis of relevant socioeconomic and environmental indicators."
