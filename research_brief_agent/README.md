Research Brief Agent

A tiny CLI tool that asks for a research topic and returns a validated Research Brief using LangChain + Google Generative AI (Gemini).

Outputs are always returned as:

‚úÖ Structured JSON (validated by Pydantic)

‚úÖ Markdown Preview (human-readable)

Example briefs are included in the samples/ folder.

# Environmental Crisis in India: Challenges and Interventions
*Date (IST):* 2025-08-24

**Objective:** India faces escalating challenges of air pollution, water scarcity, and climate-driven disasters. A focused research plan can guide policy and community interventions.

## Key Questions
- Which environmental issues are most critical for India in the next decade?
- How effective are government initiatives like Namami Gange and Ujjwala?
- What role can renewable energy adoption play in rural India?

## Methodology
- Review national and international environmental reports.
- Map current government interventions and assess implementation gaps.
- Compare state-level case studies with successful green initiatives.

## Search Strategy
- Search UNEP and MoEFCC reports using keywords: 'air pollution India', 'climate adaptation'.
- Filter IPCC summaries for South Asia references.
- Scan research portals like JSTOR for Indian environmental policy studies.

## Sources to Start
- UNEP India reports  
- Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)  
- IPCC AR6 Regional Chapters  
- TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute)  
- NITI Aayog policy briefs  

## Milestones & Timeline
- **Initial Literature Review** ‚Äî 2025-09-05: Collect and summarize 15‚Äì20 key documents  
- **Case Study Comparison** ‚Äî 2025-09-15: Analyze 3 successful state-level interventions  
- **Draft Report** ‚Äî 2025-09-20: Prepare initial draft for review  

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Data gaps or outdated reports  
  **Mitigation:** Cross-verify with multiple government and NGO sources  

- **Risk:** Timeline delays due to report availability  
  **Mitigation:** Use pre-collected open datasets as backups  

## Deliverables
- Research brief summarizing top 3‚Äì4 urgent issues  
- Comparative dataset of interventions  
- Policy recommendations for scaling renewable energy and grassroots solutions
