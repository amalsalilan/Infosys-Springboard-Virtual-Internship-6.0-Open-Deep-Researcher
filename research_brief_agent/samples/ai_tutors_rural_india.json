  "date": "2025-08-24",
  "objective": "Assess near-term feasibility of AI tutor pilots considering connectivity, teacher workload, and vernacular content needs; define a safe, measurable rollout.",
  "key_questions": [
    "What minimum device/network specs are required for reliable sessions?",
    "Which curricula and languages should be prioritized for a 3-month pilot?",
    "What safeguards are needed for accuracy, safety, and data privacy?"
  ],
  "methodology": [
    "Baseline survey of 10–15 schools: devices, bandwidth, timetable slots.",
    "Co-design sessions with teachers; create 20 exemplar lesson flows.",
    "Define guardrails: offline fallback, content filters, usage logging.",
    "Pre/post learning assessment for pilot grades."
  ],
  "search_strategy": [
    "Search 'AI tutoring RCT', 'intelligent tutoring systems India' on Google Scholar.",
    "Scan NCERT/DIKSHA for aligned open content in target languages.",
    "Review device policy and child safety guidelines from MeitY/MoE."
