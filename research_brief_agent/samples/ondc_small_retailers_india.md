# Impact of ONDC on Small Retailers in India
*Date (IST):* 2025-08-24

**Objective:** Evaluate how participation in ONDC affects discovery, sales, and margins for kirana and micro-retailers, and identify low-friction onboarding practices.

## Key Questions
- How do traffic, conversion rate, and AOV change 8–12 weeks after onboarding?
- What unit-cost drivers (logistics, commissions, tech) impact net margin?
- Which support mechanisms reduce churn and onboarding friction?

## Methodology
- Collect pre/post KPIs from 20–30 retailers (baseline + 8–12 weeks).
- Semi-structured interviews with retailers, buyer apps, and logistics partners.
- Benchmark unit economics vs. traditional channels and closed marketplaces.

## Search Strategy
- Query "ONDC impact study", "kirana ecommerce India KPIs" on Google Scholar.
- Filter news/press releases from DPIIT/ONDC for policy & fee changes.
- Scan industry blogs and analyst notes for unit-economics benchmarks.

## Sources to Start
- ONDC official blog & DPIIT announcements  
- NASSCOM/BCG/Redseer ecommerce reports  
- RBI payments data for transaction context  
- Inc42, ET Retail
