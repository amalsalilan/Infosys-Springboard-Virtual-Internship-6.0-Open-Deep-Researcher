# AI Tutors for Rural Schools in India: Pilot Plan
*Date (IST):* 2025-08-24

**Objective:** Assess near-term feasibility of AI tutor pilots considering connectivity, teacher workload, and vernacular content needs; define a safe, measurable rollout.

## Key Questions
- What minimum device/network specs are required for reliable sessions?
- Which curricula and languages should be prioritized for a 3-month pilot?
- What safeguards are needed for accuracy, safety, and data privacy?

## Methodology
- Baseline survey of 10–15 schools: devices, bandwidth, timetable slots.
- Co-design sessions with teachers; create 20 exemplar lesson flows.
- Guardrails: offline fallback, content filters, usage logging.
- Pre/post learning assessment for pilot grades.

## Search Strategy
- Google Scholar: "AI tutoring RCT", "intelligent tutoring systems India".
- NCERT/DIKSHA for aligned open content (vernacular).
- MeitY/MoE guidance on device policy & child safety.

## Sources to Start
- NCERT & DIKSHA repositories  
- UNESCO/UNICEF EdTech guidance  
- MeitY child safety and data protection advisories  
- State education ICT policies  

## Milestones & Timeline
- **Site Selection & Baseline** — 2025-09-05: Choose schools; collect baseline  
- **Content & Guardrails Setup** — 2025-09-12: Vernacular lessons; filters; logging  
- **Pilot Launch** — 2025-09-18: 6–8 week run; monitor usage  

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Connectivity/device constraints  
  **Mitigation:** Offline-first, shared devices, cached content  
- **Risk:** Hallucinations/unsafe responses  
  **Mitigation:** Curriculum-bounded prompts, filters, human review  

## Deliverables
- Pilot brief with cost envelope & success metrics  
- Lesson pack (vernacular) + deployment checklist  
- Pre/post learning outcome analysis
