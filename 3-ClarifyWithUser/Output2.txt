# Impact of Current Education Trends on Student Health

**Problem Statement:** Current education trends, such as increased screen time, standardized testing pressure, and reduced physical activity, are suspected to negatively affect student physical and mental health.  This research aims to investigate the extent and nature of this impact.

**Key Questions:**
- What are the most prevalent education trends impacting student health in 2025?
- What is the correlation between these trends and key health indicators (e.g., sleep quality, anxiety levels, physical fitness)?        
- What preventative measures or interventions could mitigate the negative effects of these trends?

**Method Brief:**
- Literature review of recent studies on education trends and student health.
- Analysis of existing datasets on student health and academic performance (if available).
- Conducting surveys and interviews with students and educators to gather qualitative data.
- Statistical analysis to identify correlations and causal relationships.

**Deliverables:**
- A comprehensive report summarizing findings and their implications.
- A presentation of key findings and recommendations for stakeholders.
