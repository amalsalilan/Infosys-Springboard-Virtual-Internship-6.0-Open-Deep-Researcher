        "- Guide the researcher to treat unspecified aspects as flexible rather than making assumptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Distinguish Between Research Scope and User Preferences\n",

        "- User preferences: Specific constraints, requirements, or preferences (must only include what user stated)\n",
