        "- If the user hasn't provided a particular detail, explicitly note this lack of specification.\n",
        "- Guide the researcher to treat unspecified aspects as flexible rather than making assumptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Distinguish Between Research Scope and User Preferences\n",
        "- Research scope: What topics/dimensions should be investigated (can be broader than user's explicit mentions)\n",
        "- User preferences: Specific constraints, requirements, or preferences (must only include what user stated)\n",
        "- Example: \"Research coffee quality factors (including bean sourcing, roasting methods, brewing techniques) for San Francisco coffee shops, with primary focus on taste as specified by the user.\"\n",

        "5. Use the First Person\n",
        "- Phrase the request from the perspective of the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Sources\n",
        "- If specific sources should be prioritized, specify them in the research question.\n",
        "- For product and travel research, prefer linking directly to official or primary websites (e.g., official brand sites, manufacturer pages, or reputable e-commerce platforms like Amazon for user reviews) rather than aggregator sites or SEO-heavy blogs.\n",
        "- For academic or scientific queries, prefer linking directly to the original paper or official journal publication rather than survey papers or secondary summaries.\n",
        "- For people, try linking directly to their LinkedIn profile, or their personal website if they have one.\n",
