I want to research the best books available in India that cover the topics of spirituality and astronomical science. I am open to all price ranges and publication dates, and I am not prioritizing any specific authors or publishers. The research should focus on identifying highly-regarded and informative books within these two subjects, considering their content, relevance, and availability in the Indian market.
