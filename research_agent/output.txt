I am looking for a report on the best places to visit in North-East India with a focus on relaxation and cultural experiences for a trip in November. Please research destinations that are optimal to visit in November, considering the weather and local conditions. The research should detail the cultural experiences available, such as festivals, historical sites, and local cuisine, as well as opportunities for relaxation, like serene landscapes or wellness activities. Please consider a range of options for budget and travel duration, as I have not specified any constraints. The final report should include information on transportation and accommodation options for the recommended locations. Prioritize information from official tourism websites and reputable travel guides.
